  <p>Pixelare (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is an AI-powered image editing tool that lets you enhance photos, apply creative effects, and generate advanced edits using natural-language or voice commands. We respect your privacy and are committed to handling all data securely, transparently, and minimally.</p>

  <h2>1. Summary — the quick version</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No ads.</strong> Pixelare does not display third-party advertising.</li>
    <li><strong>Local-first design:</strong> Your projects, images, edit history, and canvas states are stored on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced AI edits:</strong> For features such as background removal, object removal, or style transfer, Pixelare may send an image to <strong>Gemini or other third-party AI models</strong> to process your request.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions (Free, Premium, Elite). We do not process payment card details.</li>
    <li><strong>No first-party server:</strong> We do not run our own backend and do not store your images or personal data on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Data stored locally on your device</h3>
  <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted unless you use an advanced AI feature that requires cloud processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your image projects and all associated edits.</li>
    <li>Canvas states and edit history used for Undo/Redo.</li>
    <li>Locally applied filters, masks, brush selections, and adjustment settings.</li>
    <li>App preferences such as theme, tutorial completion, and user tier.</li>
    <li>Watermark settings (free vs premium).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Images and data sent for AI processing</h3>
  <p>Advanced AI-powered features (e.g., “Remove background”, “AI object removal”, “Style transfer”, “Enhance using AI”) require sending data to <strong>Gemini or other third-party AI models</strong>. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The current image or a downsized version of it.</li>
    <li>An optional selection mask (if using the brush tool).</li>
    <li>Your natural-language prompt.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By using these features, you acknowledge that data must be processed by these third-party AI models to provide the requested results.</p>

  <h3>2.3 Subscription information</h3>
  <p>RevenueCat receives and processes purchase receipts to validate your subscription tier and advanced edit quota. We do not store or handle your payment card details; Apple manages all purchases.</p>

  <h3>2.4 Technical & diagnostic information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model, OS version, app version.</li>
    <li>Crash logs used solely to improve app stability.</li>
    <li>Optional diagnostic logs (only if you enable analytics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To perform local edits:</strong> Filters, cropping, resizing, and adjustments operate entirely on-device.</li>
    <li><strong>To execute advanced AI edits:</strong> Pixelare sends your prompt and image (and mask, if any) to <strong>Gemini or other third-party AI models</strong>. Returned images replace the canvas state locally.</li>
    <li><strong>To manage subscriptions:</strong> RevenueCat determines whether features such as watermark removal or additional AI edits are available.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve stability:</strong> Crash and diagnostic logs help us maintain reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-party services we use</h2>

  <h3>4.1 RevenueCat</h3>
  <p>Purpose: manage subscriptions and entitlements.<br>
  Data shared: purchase receipts and entitlement state.<br>
  Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>

  <h3>4.2 Gemini or other third-party AI models</h3>
  <p>Purpose: generate AI-powered image edits and interpret natural-language prompts.<br>
  Data shared: the image you select for AI processing, your prompt, and any brush mask.<br>
  Note: These providers may store or process data according to their own policies.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Platform services (Apple)</h3>
  <p>Apple handles all payment processing. Apple may also provide crash logs and device diagnostics if you have enabled this at the OS level.</p>

  <h2>5. Where your data is stored</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local on your device:</strong> All images, edits, history, and projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Third party:</strong> Advanced edits processed by Gemini or other AI services; purchase receipts validated through RevenueCat/Apple.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. How long we keep your data</h2>
  <p>Your project data remains stored locally until you delete it or uninstall Pixelare. Subscription records and AI-processing logs are retained externally according to the policies of RevenueCat and the respective AI model provider.</p>

  <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local data control:</strong> Delete any project within the app or uninstall Pixelare to remove all local data.</li>
    <li><strong>AI features:</strong> Choosing to use AI features automatically permits the app to send images and prompts to third-party AI models.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage subscription:</strong> Use your Apple ID settings or the in-app “Restore Purchases” button.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Opt in or out of sharing diagnostic logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>Pixelare is rated 4+ and suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us immediately.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and administrative safeguards to protect your data. However, no digital system is fully secure. We encourage you to keep your device updated and secured with a passcode.</p>

  <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
  <p>AI model providers and RevenueCat may process data in jurisdictions outside your country. By using Pixelare you consent to such transfers for the limited purposes described in this Policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Policy updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, the “Last updated” date will change. Continued use of Pixelare means you accept the updated version.</p>
