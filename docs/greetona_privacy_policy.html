    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: August 24, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <p>Greetona (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a mobile application that helps you create personalized 3D greetings with custom audio and visuals. This Privacy Policy describes how Greetona processes information when you use our iOS and Android apps.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Short version:</strong> Greetona is designed to work offline. Your photos, audio, and greetings are processed on your device and are not uploaded to our servers. You decide if and how to share exported content.</div>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to the Greetona mobile apps and features built into them, including 3D template editing, audio recording and processing, preview, export, and app-to-app/deep‑link sharing.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Process</h2>
    <h3>2.1 On‑device content (no cloud upload)</h3>
    <p>To generate greetings, the app processes content entirely on your device, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photos and images you select to place in templates.</li>
      <li>Text you enter (names, dates, messages).</li>
      <li>Audio you record or import to personalize songs.</li>
      <li>Rendering data required to preview and export your greeting as a video.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect or transmit this creative content to our servers. Content remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it.</p>

    <h2>3. Monetization & Third Parties</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Advertising (Google Mobile Ads)</h3>
    <p>Greetona may show rewarded ads to unlock certain features. The ad provider may process device identifiers, approximate location, and interaction data to deliver and measure ads, in accordance with their own privacy policy. You can control ad personalization in your device settings where supported.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Purchases & Subscriptions (RevenueCat)</h3>
    <p>For subscriptions and in‑app purchases, we use a purchase infrastructure provider to validate receipts and manage access (e.g., subscription status). The provider receives purchase‑related data from Apple/Google that is necessary to operate your entitlements. We do not receive or store your full payment instrument details.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Platform Services</h3>
    <p>We rely on Apple and Google platform services (e.g., App Store / Play billing, system share sheets, media library access). These platforms may process data under their own policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing & Deep Links</h2>
    <p>When you export or share a greeting (e.g., as a video or via a deep link), the chosen app or platform (e.g., Messages, WhatsApp, Instagram) will handle that content under its own terms and policies. Deep links can encode greeting data for another Greetona user to open on their device. Only share links with people you trust.</p>

    <h2>5. App Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos/Media/Library:</strong> to select images and save exported videos.</li>
      <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> to record custom audio for placeholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage/File Access:</strong> to read/write assets and exported content.</li>
      <li><strong>Network:</strong> limited use (e.g., ads, purchases, updates). Core features work offline.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications (optional):</strong> if enabled, to inform you about exports, tips, or updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke permissions in your device settings; some features may stop working without the corresponding permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Greetona is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use an offline‑first design so your creative content stays on your device. For data handled by third parties (ads, purchases), those providers apply their own security measures. Always keep your device updated and protected.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your creative content persists locally until you delete it or uninstall the app. Purchase records and ad‑related data may be retained by the respective providers to comply with legal and operational requirements. We do not maintain user accounts or cloud copies of your greetings.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Third‑party providers and platform companies may process data on servers located in various countries. Where required, they implement appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Change or revoke app permissions at any time in system settings.</li>
      <li>Delete content by removing assets inside the app or uninstalling the app.</li>
      <li>Manage ad preferences via device settings (where available).</li>
      <li>Manage purchases and subscriptions via the App Store / Google Play account settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our app or legal requirements. We will update the “Effective date” above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice in the app.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
