      <h1>Pawmpanion — Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        Effective date: December 2, 2025<br>
        Last updated: December 2, 2025
      </div>
    </header>

    <p>Pawmpanion (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is an AI-powered companion app that lets you chat with expressive animal personas, collect Core Memories, and build bond levels. We respect your privacy and keep data handling transparent, secure, and minimal. This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how to manage your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Summary — the quick version</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No ads.</strong> Pawmpanion does not display advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Local-first data:</strong> Chats, Souls, Core Memories, and bond data are stored on your device by default.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage purchases and entitlements (no payment card data is handled by us).</li>
      <li><strong>LLM calls:</strong> The app calls a cloud generative model (Gemini) to produce replies and TTS audio. See Section 3 for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Data stored locally on your device</h3>
    <p>By design, the following user data is stored locally on your device (SQLite / AsyncStorage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chat transcripts with each animal persona (messages you send and replies from the persona).</li>
      <li>Core Memories — collectible milestone records and their rarities (used to award bond points).</li>
      <li>Bond scores and progression state (used to compute bond level and unlocks).</li>
      <li>Selected persona/avatar IDs and UI preferences (theme, last selected persona).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information used for subscription management</h3>
    <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and entitlements. RevenueCat will store and process purchase receipts and entitlement state. We do not store payment card details — Apple handles payment processing for iOS purchases.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Technical & diagnostic information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model, OS version, app version, and crash logs (used to improve reliability).</li>
      <li>Non-identifying usage metrics and feature diagnostics (only if you enable diagnostic logging in app settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To power conversations:</strong> When you send a message, the app may send the message to a generative language model (Gemini) to produce a persona reply. This is required for the core function of the product.</li>
      <li><strong>To synthesize TTS audio:</strong> We may request Gemini TTS (or fall back to native TTS) to produce persona voices for audio playback.</li>
      <li><strong>To manage subscriptions:</strong> We use RevenueCat to check entitlements and show Premium/Elite features.</li>
      <li><strong>To improve app stability:</strong> Crash logs help us fix bugs — they are not used for advertising or profiling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-party services we use</h2>
    <h3>4.1 RevenueCat</h3>
    <p>Purpose: subscription management and entitlements. Data shared: purchase receipts and entitlement state. Learn more at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Gemini / Cloud LLM</h3>
    <p>Purpose: generate persona replies and high-quality TTS audio when enabled. The exact fields sent depend on app configuration and privacy toggles. Please note: the Gemini API provider’s privacy policy applies to data processed by the model provider.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Platform services</h3>
    <p>We rely on Apple / Google platform services for in-app billing, and the platform provider's terms apply to payment processing and receipts.</p>

    <h2>5. Where your data is stored</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local on your device:</strong> Chat history, Core Memories, and bond scores.</li>
      <li><strong>Third party:</strong> Subscription receipts & entitlement state (RevenueCat). Cloud LLM requests are sent to the LLM provider to get a reply when you interact with a persona. We do not run a first-party backend or permanently store user chat transcripts on our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>Local data remains on your device until you uninstall the app, or until you choose to delete it from within the app (delete chat / reset). Subscription records are kept by RevenueCat/Apple per their policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Remove local data:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes local chat data. You can also clear chats, memories, and bonds from the app UI if provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage subscription:</strong> Cancel, manage, or restore purchases via your Apple ID / RevenueCat restore flow in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> You may opt out of sending diagnostic logs if the app offers a diagnostics toggle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>Pawmpanion is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect data stored in the app and data transmitted to third parties (e.g., encryption for network requests). However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Because the app may call cloud services located in different jurisdictions (LLM provider, RevenueCat), data transmitted to those services may be processed outside your country. By using the app you acknowledge these transfers for the limited purpose of generating replies and managing subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>11. Policy updates</h2>
    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date shown at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important technical note:</strong> The app is built as a serverless, local-first client that uses Gemini for replies and RevenueCat for subscription management. For implementation details and data flow assumptions see the Leviathan app architecture documentation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
