    <h1>Pawmpanion Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>
      Pawmpanion respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled
      when you use the Pawmpanion mobile application (“App”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Pawmpanion is designed to be local-first. We do not require you to create an account and
      do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or
      physical address.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chat conversations, preferences, and companion interactions are stored locally on your
      device. This data is used solely to provide the app’s functionality and is not shared with us.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Audio and Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to use voice input features, the app may request access to your device’s
      microphone to convert your spoken words into text. Audio is processed only to enable
      this feature and is not stored or used for tracking or advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Pawmpanion uses third-party services solely to provide core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> – Used to generate AI responses. Message content is
        sent securely to generate replies and is not used for advertising.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat</strong> – Used to manage in-app subscriptions. Payment details are
        handled entirely by Apple App Store or Google Play and are never accessible to us.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      Pawmpanion offers optional auto-renewing subscriptions. All purchases are processed
      through the App Store or Google Play. We do not collect or store payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, tracking, or analytics. Pawmpanion
      does not show ads and does not sell or share user data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is stored locally on your device. While no method of storage is completely
      secure, we take reasonable measures to ensure the app operates securely.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You may delete all app data at any time by uninstalling the app from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>
      Pawmpanion is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
      collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child under
      13 has provided personal information through the app, please contact us and we will take
      appropriate steps to delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on
      this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>
